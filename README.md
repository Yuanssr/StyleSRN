# StyleSRN: Scene Text Image Super-Resolution with Text Style Embedding
Abstract. Scene text image super-resolution (STISR) focuses on enhancing the clarity and readability of low-resolution text images. Existing methods often rely on text probability distribution priors derived from text recognizers to guide the super-resolution process. While effective in capturing general structural information of text, these priors lack the ability to preserve specific text style details, such as font, stereoscopic effect and spatial transformation, leading to a loss of visual quality and stylistic consistency in the super-resolved images. To address these limitations, we propose a Style embedding-based scene text image Super-Resolution Network (StyleSRN), which introduces a text style embedding mechanism to preserve and enhance text style features during the super-resolution process. The proposed architecture includes a Style Enhancement Block for capturing multi-scale cross-channel dependencies, and a Style Content Fusion Block that effectively integrates text content with style information, ensuring that the structure and style of the restored text are not distorted. Furthermore, we introduce a Text Style Loss based on the Gram matrix to supervise the reconstruction process at the style level, thereby maintaining the stylistic consistency of the restored text images. Extensive experiments on the TextZoom dataset and five scene text recognition benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method.
